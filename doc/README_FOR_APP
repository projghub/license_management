Acceptance Criteria

Training is hell

As an APM, when I sell less licenses and turn down licenses in LMS, then LMS should update Central with the correct amount of licenses (or correct as possible, meaning not taking away assigned licenses).

We have 12 renewal dates (last day of every month)

Perpertual license is 1 or 4 years

NetSuite (our CRM)
Salesman puts in Opportunities

Purchase order comes in
Click on receive Purchase Order

All I care about is "Are they on an Engine?" and "Are they on a Server?"

Purchase Order Sale Number = NetSuite.Opportunity sales number

Opportunity -> Quote -> Sales Order -> Invoice  (what we use to bill the customer)

LMS controls the root level of Central

Report happens end of each month 30, 60, 90, automatically gets sent to the APM
salesmen look at the report each month so they know who to call

There is not a place to add Spanish Licenses

LMS never decreases the license count in Central

The report only goes to Julie from Central.  The report needs to go to Frantz (and others) to help clean up Central licenses that are not needed.

NetSuite generate the Sales Order number, and we manually put it into LMS.  We need a way to search by the PO number is the customers internal
We need to be able to search by Invoice number as well

Glossary
Allocate Purchase Order - Take purchase order and divide the licenses between Schools in one District
Purchase Order Number - Unique from the Customer, we enter into NetSuite
Sales Order Number ( Sale Number ) - Generated in NetSuite (our internal number) from our Purchase Order Number
On a Sale - is where all the work happens
Invoice Number - We generate this when we create an invoice to send to the customer
On an Invoice - Commissions are paid, revenue is released, customer is billed
Renewal Rate - 
Reassign License - Needs to retain the same renewal license
Killing - We get rid of them if Schools don't need them or they haven't paid for them
Closed License - If a School closes and the license(s) are transferred elsewhere in the District
Post Sale Contract -

License Management System (LMS)
NetSuite - Our CRM
Central - This is our phone home server for all of our engines.
PSC.xlsx - Julie's super-de-duper custom spreadsheet

We want post sale contracts to go away
We need to avoid Double/Triple entry into CRM, LMS, and Central and THE BEAST

We are not tracking what product version of the product they have

Have a way to put in License Types

Allocation happens in Central, if the district is on a server

Allocation happens in LMS if everyone has their own Engine


The glitch has to do when transferring licenses.  The program "renews itself" sometimes

State wide licensing has special cases and it's own issues
LMS pre-dates NetSuite (5+) years

What does LMS do that are not done in NetSuite?  We can set renewal dates and a report (30/60/90) is sent to every APM.
Nightly update

This calculates "Renewal Rates"
